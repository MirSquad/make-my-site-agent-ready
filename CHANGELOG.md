# Changelog

## 1.5.0 — 2026-07-14

### New feature

- Add: Optional JSON-LD structured data — a new `mmsar_structured_data` checkbox (off by default) in Settings > Agent-Ready adds a minimal `Article` (for posts) or `WebPage` (for pages/other post types) block to each enabled post/page, with an `encoding`/`MediaObject` field pointing at the same `.md` URL used by the existing `<link>` tag and `Link` header. New `includes/class-mmsar-structured-data.php`.
- Deliberately omits `@id` and stays minimal so it can't collide with or duplicate an active SEO plugin's own JSON-LD graph (e.g. Yoast, RankMath) — a new admin notice warns (without blocking) if the setting is enabled while one of those is active.
- Prompted by the plugin's own agent-readiness gap tracking flagging "structured data for agents" as the one item from the v1.4.2/1.4.3 batch that hadn't shipped yet.

## 1.4.3 — 2026-07-06

### New feature

- Add: Content Signals — a new `mmsar_content_signals` option (three yes/no values: `search`, `ai_input`, `ai_train`) with an admin settings section (Settings > Agent-Ready), and a new `mmsar_content_signal_line()` helper that builds the `Content-Signal: search=..., ai-input=..., ai-train=...` directive (contentsignals.org / IETF AI Preferences draft) from it. Emitted once under each of the plugin's own AI-crawler groups in `robots.txt` (GPTBot, ClaudeBot, Anthropic-AI, GoogleOther, PerplexityBot, FacebookBot) — deliberately not under `User-agent: *`, since that group is Yoast's, not this plugin's. Skips auto-adding if the site owner already has a manual `Content-Signal:` line in the Additional Rules textarea, to avoid emitting a conflicting duplicate.
- Default values: `search=yes, ai-input=yes, ai-train=no` — allow indexing and live AI retrieval, decline training-corpus use by default.
- Prompted by isitagentready.com flagging the absence of Content Signals in robots.txt.

## 1.4.2 — 2026-07-06

### New feature

- Add: HTTP `Link` response headers (RFC 8288) on every front-end response — `Link: </.well-known/api-catalog>; rel="api-catalog"` and `Link: </.well-known/agent-skills/index.json>; rel="service-desc"`, plus a third on singular posts/pages mirroring the existing `<link rel="alternate" type="text/markdown">` tag as a real header. Prompted by isitagentready.com flagging the homepage's missing Link headers.
- Refactored the markdown-URL logic shared by both the `<link>` tag and the new header into one function, `mmsar_get_markdown_url()`, so they can't drift out of sync.
- Hooked to `template_redirect`, not `send_headers` — `send_headers` fires before `WP_Query` resolves the main query, so `is_front_page()`/`is_singular()` are not yet reliable there. `template_redirect` fires after the query resolves and before any template output.

## 1.4.1 — 2026-07-06

### Bug fix

- Fix: `MMSAR_Server`'s broad `.md` catch-all rewrite rule (`^(.+)\.md/?$`, used for post/page markdown URLs) also matched `/.well-known/agent-skills/fetch-content-as-markdown/SKILL.md`, and won over the more specific Agent Skills rewrite rule regardless of registration order — the Agent Skills file 404'd as a result. Fixed with a negative lookahead (`^(?!\.well-known/)(.+)\.md/?$`) so the catch-all only ever matches actual post/page slugs, never a `/.well-known/` path. Found via live verification immediately after the 1.4.0 install: `api-catalog` and the Agent Skills `index.json` both served correctly, but the `SKILL.md` file itself returned MMSAR_Server's "content not found" 404 — the exact message text made the true cause traceable.

## 1.4.0 — 2026-07-06

### New features

- Add: `/.well-known/api-catalog` (RFC 9727) — a Linkset (RFC 9264) JSON document indexing llms.txt, llms-full.txt, security.txt, the Agent Skills index, sitemap, and feed in one machine-readable file.
- Add: Agent Skills discovery — `/.well-known/agent-skills/index.json` plus one bundled skill (`fetch-content-as-markdown`) at `/.well-known/agent-skills/fetch-content-as-markdown/SKILL.md`, teaching agents how to use this plugin's `.md`, llms.txt, and llms-full.txt endpoints instead of parsing HTML. New `includes/class-mmsar-agent-skills.php`.
- Add: Quick Links for both new endpoints in Settings > Agent-Ready.

### Improvement

- Version bumps now trigger an automatic `flush_rewrite_rules()` on the next request, so new rewrite rules (like the two added in this release) take effect without requiring a manual Permalinks resave — updating a plugin's files in place doesn't re-fire the activation hook.

## 1.3.3 — 2026-06-18

### Improvement

- Add: robots.txt "Current Content" read-only preview in the settings page, showing exactly what gets served — so users can verify the AI crawler rules are present without leaving the admin.

## 1.3.2 — 2026-06-18

### New features

- Add: robots.txt settings section in Settings > Agent-Ready — shows a link to the live file and an "Additional Rules" textarea for custom directives appended after the AI crawler rules.
- Add: robots.txt Quick Link in the settings page footer alongside llms.txt, llms-full.txt, and security.txt.

## 1.3.1 — 2026-06-15

### Bug fixes

- Fix: Remove `X-Robots-Tag: noindex` header from `/llms.txt` and `/llms-full.txt` — these files are meant to be discovered by AI agents, not hidden from crawlers.
- Fix: Add rewrite rule routing `robots.txt` through WordPress (`index.php?robots=1`) so the `robots_txt` filter (and AI crawler rules) fires even when a physical `robots.txt` file exists on disk.
- Add: Admin notice when a static `robots.txt` file is detected in the webroot, warning that CDNs (e.g. Cloudflare) may serve it directly, bypassing the plugin's AI crawler rules.

## 1.3.0 — 2026-06-15

### Plugin renamed: LLM Markdown → Make My Site Agent-Ready

- Slug: `make-my-site-agent-ready` (available on WP.org)
- Main file: `make-my-site-agent-ready.php`
- All prefixes updated: `LLMMD_` → `MMSAR_`, `llmmd_` → `mmsar_` (option keys kept as `llmmd_*` for data continuity)
- Text domain: `make-my-site-agent-ready`
- Admin menu: Settings > Agent-Ready

### New features

- Add: `/llms-full.txt` endpoint — full site content concatenated as markdown with `---` dividers (title + URL + content per entry). Cached with 24h TTL, invalidated on save/settings change.
- Add: `/.well-known/security.txt` endpoint — plain-text security.txt per RFC 9116. Configurable via Settings > Agent-Ready; falls back to auto-generated default using admin email.
- Add: AI crawler rules in `robots.txt` — explicit `Allow: /` for GPTBot, ClaudeBot, Anthropic-AI, GoogleOther, PerplexityBot, FacebookBot; adds `Sitemap:` directive if not already present.

### Bug fix

- Fix: trailing slash redirect on `/llms.txt` (and other plugin endpoints) — `redirect_canonical` filter now returns `false` for all plugin-owned paths before WordPress can append a trailing slash.

### Abilities API

- Fix: `regenerate-files` ability now always registered — no opt-in checkbox required
- Change: `regenerate-files` marked `destructive: true` so AI tools prompt for confirmation before running
- Remove: "Enable write abilities" checkbox and `llmmd_write_abilities` option
